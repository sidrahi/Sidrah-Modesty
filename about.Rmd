I chose to make this website because I believe that being modest is part of our deen (Islam).

“Every religion has its distinct characteristic, and the distinct characteristic of Islam is modesty.” It was narrated from Abu Bakr (RA) that the Messenger of Allah (SAW) said: “Modesty is part of faith, and faith will be in Paradise. Obscenity in speech is part of harshness and harshness will be in Hell.'”
